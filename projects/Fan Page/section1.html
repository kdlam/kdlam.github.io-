				<h3>I have always loved matcha, but if I'm being honest, I never really did my research on what it's so meaningful in Japanese culture. To me, matcha used to just be a drink from Japan. That is until my friend recently called me out and talked about what matcha means to her and her family in Japan. Matcha has a very special history and holds significance in Japanese culture. </h3>

				<h3>Contrary to popular belief, the tea actually originated in China during the Tang Dynasty where the Chinese would ground the tea leaves to make powder for easier transportation and trade. </h3>

				<h3>In 1191, a Japanese Buddhist monk Eisai brought tea leaves from China back to Kyoto, but it wasn’t until the 1500s did the Japanese develop tea ceremony traditions with matcha. </h3>

				<h3> The Japanese Tea Ceremony is called “Chado” or “Sado.” <p>Translated, this means “The Way of Tea.” A lot of preparation goes into drinking tea in Japanese culture. It is often served to guests by hosts, and thus, commemorates a special moment of hospitality and strong bond. Matcha should also be enjoyed with just as much care and should be a mindful practice</h3>
