  		<h3>Matcha comes from Japan. 
Yoga and turmeric come from India. 
Quinoa comes from Peru and South America.

None of these “health” foods are white, and yet, they are still being commercialized in the wellness market and sold for an alarmingly jacked up price.

The White-Savior complex is everywhere–food and health is no exception.

I talked to some of my Japanese friends, including my childhood friend, and here’s what some of the more strongly opinionated ones had to say about the growing popularity in matcha:

<p><span style="color: #F4C2C2;">“Why does America have to turn matcha into a cup of diabetes?”
<p><span style="color: #F4C2C2;">“When I tell people I am Japanese, they just tell me how much they love matcha...”
<p><span style="color: #F4C2C2;">“I never order matcha in the US.”</span>


<p>My opinion?
It’s definitely a tricky topic .I personally love yoga and incorporating foods like quinoa to give texture to my foods. I think it’s great that different cultural foods are being accepted and widely appreciated in the U.S. But I think that there is, in fact, a right and wrong way to “appreciate” these things. We should all try to be more respectful and at least try to educate ourselves around what the traditional practice of consuming matcha means in Japanese culture. 

Corporations like the popular chain Cha Cha Matcha and our friends at Starbucks don’t do a very good job at this... Adding a unique twist to something traditional can definitely be cool, but if it’s to the point where the actual culture is not recognizable in the end product anymore, then that’s a different story.
