  		<h3>If you have Instagram, you know what I'm talking about.

“That Girl” is the girl who wakes up at 7am, goes to yoga, makes a smoothie, then drinks her matcha while journaling and having her perfect little life together.

Social media helped this recent obsession with being That Girl grow, and matcha continues to become popular because of our gal pal here. 

The problem with this, however, is that social media takes away the cultural significance of matcha and gives it a more superficial purpose. 

Sure, there are scientific studies that it helps reduces the risk of heart disease, stroke, cancer, arthritis, and a decline in cognitive function. The motivation for drinking matcha no longer becomes enjoying and appreciating a culture; it almost becomes a platform to seem trendy.

<p> Why does everything have to be commemorated on social media? Would matcha even be this popular without the help of Addison Rae's tweet? Without the Instagram algorithm? Without Diplo investing in chains like Cha Cha Matcha?
